RevStar Project
Overview

RevStar is a .NET 9-based project aimed at providing a high-performance data ingestion and processing framework. It is designed for modularity, scalability, and interoperability with native code components written in C, C++, and Rust.
This project forms the core of a system inspired by the RevSeek3 repository, restructured for efficiency and maintainability in .NET 9.

Features
Modular Architecture: Clean separation of components into foundation, loaders, and testing layers.
High Performance: Optimized for large-scale data ingestion.
Interoperability: Interfaces designed to integrate seamlessly with native libraries in C, C++, and Rust.
Extensibility: Easy to add new data sources or processing pipelines.
Comprehensive Testing: Built-in unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET 9 SDK
IDE or editor with .NET 9 support (e.g., Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio Code)
NuGet Package Manager

Project Structure
RevStar.Foundation: Core interfaces and utilities.
RevStar.Loader: Data ingestion and preprocessing components.
RevStar.Tests: Unit and integration tests for all modules.

Roadmap
Add support for additional data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, Avro).
Integrate with C++ and Rust modules for advanced processing.
Enhance the testing framework for large-scale performance tests.
Optimize ingestion pipelines for real-time processing.
